SUMMARY

In today's class we learnt about various ways of cloning repositories, editing files, pushing,pulling of the reposotories.
we learnt how to do that with GiHub desktop application. In previous classes we also got to know how to do that in terminal.
We learnt about the git command "diff" which allows us to compare between the origin main repository and the current repository whether we have done any changes or not.

We also learnt about markdown and HTML. We will also study about how we can create our own pages in the upcomming lectures!
